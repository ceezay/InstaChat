# InstaChat

In this project I am demonstrating a chat application which can handle multiple users at the same time. It also supports file transfer.

It is entirely based on Java and consists of two parts: jMessenger (client application) and jServer (server application).

# Features

* Handles multiple users at the same time
* Support for both public and private messages
* User signup and login available 
* Support for file transfer
